* Notes
* To Do
** DONE Assembler should output actual binary
** DONE Create a disassembler
** DONE emulator needs to be able read binary output from assembler
** DONE refactor disassembler and emulator to share disassembly code
** TODO assembler and disassembler needs to support multi-word instructions
** TODO Add support to the emulator for operations besides SET
* Scratch
new goal for the assembler: be able to reproduce notch's test program
